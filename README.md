- I modified the Makefile to include the minwin library. It will look for the minwin folder in the home directory (~) so make sure to have the minwin folder at the right place.  

- To see my latest work : 
  - make clean
  - make all
  - ./bin/test_scene \<path for obj file\>

I also writed some code to manage the difference of scale between the teapot and the tetrahedron so they can be loaded together.
