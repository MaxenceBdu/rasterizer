- I added a test file in which I open a minwin window that displays a shape from the slides. It is compiled as **bin/test_scene**.  
- I also modified the Makefile to include the minwin library. It will look for the minwin folder in the home directory (~) so make sure to have the minwin folder at the right place.
- To compile : 
  - make clean
  - make all
